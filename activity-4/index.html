                Salt lamps, a.k.a. Himalayan Salt Lamps, are rocks of Himalayan pink salt
                encasing a lightbulb.
                <br>Salt lamps illuminate any room with a warm, soft, glow and
                lay claim to a barrage of benefits including:
                <br>
                <ul id="benefits">
                    <li>Air purification</li>
                    <li>Stress relief</li>
                    <li>Sleep assistance</li>
                </ul>
                However, whether or not these claims hold any weight is up for debate.
